Currently an Assistant Professor in Cyber Information Security and Intelligent Transportation System ([CISITS](https://scholar.ui.ac.id/en/organisations/cisits-lab-cyber-information-security-and-intelligent-transportat/)) Lab, Department of Mathematics at Universitas Indonesia and also a Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham, working in [Christophe Petit](https://christophe.petit.web.ulb.be)'s group. Previously, I received my PhD from Budapest University of Technology and Economics, Hungary, under the supervision of [Gábor Ivanyos](https://sztaki.hun-ren.hu/en/organisation/departments/ilab/gabor-ivanyos).
My research interest primarily lies in the intersection of algebra, number theory, and theoretical computer science. Currently, I focus on studying and developing quantum algorithms for cryptanalysis.
