I am a faculty member at the department of mathematics of [Universitas Indonesia](https://www.ui.ac.id). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D from Budapest University of Technology and Economics under the supervision of [GÃ¡bor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). Before that, I completed my master's degree in mathematics with specialization in algebra, geometry, and number theory at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/mathematics/algebra-geometry-and-number-theory).

Currently, I am working on:
* Quantum algorithms, especially for some variants of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP);
* HSP-based cryptanalysis for post-quantum cryptography;
* Quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography.
