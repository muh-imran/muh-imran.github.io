I am a faculty member in the department of mathematics at [Universitas Indonesia](https://www.ui.ac.id). Previously, I did my Ph.D from Budapest University of Technology and Economics under the supervision of [GÃ¡bor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). Prior to that, I completed my master's degree in mathematics at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/mathematics/algebra-geometry-and-number-theory).

My reasearch interests lie in computational algebra and its applications in computer science (particularly, in quantum computing and cryptography). Currently, I am working on:
* Quantum algorithms, especially for some variants of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP);
* HSP-based cryptanalysis for post-quantum cryptography;
* Quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography.
