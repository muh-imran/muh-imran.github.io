I am a professional lecturer at Informatics Faculty ([School of Computing](https://telkomuniversity.ac.id/en/school-of-informatics/)) of Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia. Currently, I am on leave for finishing my Ph.D at [Doctoral School of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://doktori.math.bme.hu/english/index-E.html) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics under the supervision of [GÃ¡bor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). 


My research interests lie in computational algebra & number theory, and their applications in computer science. Currently, I am working on:
* Quantum algorithms, especially for some variants of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP);
* HSP-based cryptanalysis for post-quantum cryptography, especially for isogeny-based cryptography;
* Quantum cryptography, especially multi-party quantum computation.

## What's new??

* (31-03-2023) I just finished my first work on quantum cryptography, <i>A private set intersection protocol based on multi-party quantum computation for greatest common divisor</i>, and submitted for publication.
* (15-02-2023) We have finally submitted our paper <i>Hidden stabilizer and the Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem</i> to [Crypto 2023](https://crypto.iacr.org/2023/). This is my first work on post-quantum cryptography, especially isogeny-based cryptography.
* (29-08-2022) I got hired as a profesional lecturer in Informatics Faculty of [Telkom University](https://telkomuniversity.ac.id) and I will start my duty right after my PhD completion.
