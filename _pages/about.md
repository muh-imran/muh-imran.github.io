I am a professional lecturer at Informatics Faculty ([School of Computing](https://telkomuniversity.ac.id/en/school-of-informatics/)) of Telkom University, Bandung, Indonesia. Currently, I am on leave for finishing my Ph.D at [Doctoral School of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://doktori.math.bme.hu/english/index-E.html) at Budapest University of Technology and Economics under the supervision of [GÃ¡bor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). 


My research interests lie in computational algebra & number theory, and their applications in computer science. Currently, I am working on:
* Quantum algorithms, especially for some variants of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP);
* HSP-based cryptanalysis for post-quantum cryptography, especially for isogeny-based cryptography;
* Quantum cryptography, especially multi-party quantum computation.

## What's new??

* (17-04-2023) We just finalized our manuscript on exact quantum HSP algorithm, <i>Zero sum subsequences and hidden subgroups</i>, which provides an efficient exact quantum HSP algorithm for nilpotent groups.
* (31-03-2023) I just finished my first work on quantum cryptography, <i>A private set intersection protocol based on multi-party quantum computation for greatest common divisor</i>, and submitted for publication.
