I am a Ph.D student diving into computational algebra and quantum computing at [Doctoral School of Mathematics and Computer Science](https://doktori.math.bme.hu/english/index-E.html) of Budapest University of Technology and Economics under the supervision of [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). 

Previously, I finished my master degree in mathematics specialized in algebra, geometry, and number theory at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/mathematics/algebra-geometry-and-number-theory). I studied Gröbner basis for decoding linear codes in my master thesis under the supervision of [Bas Edixhoven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bas_Edixhoven).

Currently, I am working on:
* Quantum algorithms, especially for some variants of the hidden subgroup problem (HSP);
* HSP-based cryptanalysis for post-quantum cryptography;
* Quantum cryptography.

## What's new??
* (10-05-2023) Our paper entitled <i>Hidden stabilizer, the Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem and Cryptanalysis of [pSIDH](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22966-4_1)</i>  is accepted in [Asiacrypt 2023](http://asiacrypt.iacr.org/).
* (17-04-2023) We just finalized our manuscript on exact quantum HSP algorithm, <i>Zero sum subsequences and hidden subgroups</i>, which provides an efficient exact quantum HSP algorithm for nilpotent groups.
* (31-03-2023) I just finished my first work on quantum cryptography, <i>A private set intersection protocol based on multi-party quantum computation for greatest common divisor</i>, and submitted for publication.
