I am a PhD student at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/) as part of the [NTNU Applied Cryptography Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab). I work in Post-Quantum Cryptography, with a focus on systems based on isogenies between elliptic curves. I mostly enjoy cryptanalysis and efficient instantiation of such systems. I work under the supervision of my main supervisor [prof. Colin Boyd](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/colin.boyd), and my co-supervisors [dr. Craig Costello](https://www.craigcostello.com.au/) and [prof. Kristian Gj√∏steen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.gjosteen).

I enjoy a good Capture the Flag (CTF) contest, especially cryptography related challenges. If you have not already, I recommend checking out [Cryptohack](https://cryptohack.org/), where I have contributed a few challenges.

Sometimes I also [cover songs I think are cool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCen9gXZ2ZPbcVz4a7vZo7dA).
