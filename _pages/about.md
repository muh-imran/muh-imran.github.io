I am a PhD student at the [Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)](https://www.ntnu.edu/) as part of the [NTNU Applied Cryptology Lab](https://www.ntnu.edu/iik/nacl-lab). I work in post-quantum cryptography, with a focus on systems based on isogenies between elliptic curves. Currently, I primarily enjoy cryptanalysis and efficient instantiation of such systems. I work under the supervision of my main supervisor [prof. Colin Boyd](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/colin.boyd), and my co-supervisors [dr. Craig Costello](https://www.craigcostello.com.au/) and [prof. Kristian Gj√∏steen](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/kristian.gjosteen).

Sometimes I also [cover songs I think are cool](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCen9gXZ2ZPbcVz4a7vZo7dA).
