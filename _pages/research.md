### <u>Zero sum subsequences and hidden subgroups</u>
(April - 2023) <br>Authors: [Muhammd Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io) & [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). <br>The preprint version is available in [arXiv]()
  
In this project, we succeed to construct the first exact quantum hidden subgroup algorithm for a class of non-abelian groups, namely nilpotent groups of constant class and the prime factors of the group order are also constant. The main key of the algorithm is by series of reductions to groups of smaller nilpotency class (through its central series) using new zero sum subsequences algorithm in the group $\mathbb{Z}_p^n$ for prime number $p$.

### <u>A private set intersection protocol based on multi-party quantum computation for greatest common divisor</u>
(March - 2023) <br>Author: [Muhammad Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io). <br>The paper is submitted to [Quantum Inf. Process](https://www.springer.com/journal/11128). The preprint version is available in [Cryptology ePrint Archive](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/476).

Private set intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic primitive that allows two or more parties to learn the intersection of their input sets and nothing else. In this paper, we present a private set intersection protocol based on a new secure multi-party quantum protocol for greatest common divisor (GCD). Performance analysis guarantees the correctness and it also shows that the proposed protocols are completely secure in semi-honest model. Moreover, the complexity is proven to be efficient (poly logarithmic) in the size of the input sets.

### <u>Hidden stabilizers and the Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem</u>
(February - 2023) <br>Author: [Muhammad Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io), [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/), [Péter Kutas](https://sites.google.com/view/peterkutas89/main-page?authuser=0), & [Antonin Leroux](https://tonioecto.github.io/antoninleroux/). <br> The paper is submitted to [Crypto 2023](https://crypto.iacr.org/2023/).

This paper studies relations between some fundamental computational problems in isogeny-based cryptography. Moreover, we construct a new approach on attacking the Isogeny to Endomorphism Ring Problem (IsERP) using a new quantum algorithm for Borel hidden subgroup problem. We propose a quantum polynomial-time attack with subexponential classical precomputation on IsERP for any isogeny degree.  A key implication of this is that one should not reuse the starting curve and the degree in [pSIDH](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-22966-4_1).

### <u>An exact quantum order finding algorithm and its applications</u>
(May - 2022) <br>Author: [Muhammad Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io). <br>The preprint version is available in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04240).

We propose an efficient exact quantum order finding algorithm where a multiple of the order is known. As applications, it derandomizes the quantum algorithm for primality testing proposed by Donis-Vela and Garcia-Escartin. In the field of quantum cryptography, we propose an improved version of the multiparty quantum computation for least common multiple proposed recently by Li and Liu. Finally, the algorithm serves as a subroutine of an efficient exact quantum algorithm for finding primitive elements in arbitrary finite fields.

### <u>An exact quantum hidden subgroup algorithm and applications to solvable groups</u>
(February - 2022) <br>Authors: [Muhammd Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io) & [Gábor Ivanyos](http://old.sztaki.hu/~ivanyos/). <br>The paper is available in [Quantum Inf. Comput.](https://doi.org/10.26421/QIC22.9-10-4) or the preprint version in [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04047).

The natural characteristic of quantum algorithms is probabilistic, since it takes advantage from the quantum principles (superposition, interference, entanglement, etc.). Therefore, it is a natural question whether it is possible to boost up the probability to certainty while maintaining the efficiency. In the hidden subgroup problem, the existing of exact quantum algorithms is still limited. In this paper, we construct an exact quantum algorithm for the hidden subgroup problem in the infinite family of groups $\mathbb{Z}_{m^k}^n$ and its the applications in some computational problems in solvable groups.

### <u>Stripped, multidimensional version of the Childs–van Dam approach to the hidden multiple shift problem</u>
Author: [Muhammd Imran](https://muh-imran.github.io).

The hidden multiple shift problem (HMS) can be seen as an interpolation between the abelian and dihedral hidden subgroup problems. The problem includes the two extream cases an abelian hidden subgroup problem which can be efficiently solved by quantum computers, and the dihedral hidden subgroup problem in which the best known quantum algorithm ([Kuperberg's algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0302112)) has subexponential complexity. The study of HMS recently appears as a promising approach to both lattice-based and  isogeny-based cryptography, see [BKSW18](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-76581-5_24) and [IIKL23]() respectively. In this project, we would like to construct a stripped (free of "pretty good measurement") version of the [Childs-van Dam](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0507190) method to the hidden multiple shift problem for multidimensional case, particularly for constant dimension/rank.

### <u>Hidden subgroup problem in cryptography: a survey</u>
Author: Muhammad Imran

In this survey, we conduct a systematic literature review on the most recent and important development in classical and quantum algorithms for some instances of finite hidden subgroup problem which have strong connections with cryptography: lattice-based cryptography, isogeny-based cryptography, and some secure cryptographic protocols. The main purpose of this survey is to give cryptographic motivations for further investigations on finite hidden subgroup problem.
