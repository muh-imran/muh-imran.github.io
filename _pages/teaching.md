### Universitas Indonesia
---
As a lecturer at the University of Indonesia, I teach several undergraduate courses each semester, primarily in Algebra and Cryptography. In addition to teaching, I actively seek to supervise students' research projects in mathematical cryptography and computational algebra.

Students' research projects:
* Brayen Damara: The Shifted Discrete Logarithm Problem on Finite Semigroups as a Basis for Post-Quantum Cryptography Protocols
* Muhammad Ferry Husnil: On the Classical Hardness of the Semidirect Discrete Logarithm Problem in Finite Groups
* Fritz Adelbertus Sitindaon: Hawk Signature Protocol
* Nurshafa Aliya: Tropical Cryptography

### Budapest University of Technology and Economics
---
During my PhD, I taught some algebra and computer science courses.
* Mathematics M1: Basic Graph and Probability Theory for Civil Engineering MSc students (Fall 2023)
* Introduction to Algebra 2 (Spring 2022)
* Introduction to Algebra 1 (Fall 2021)
* Informatics 2 (Spring 2021)
